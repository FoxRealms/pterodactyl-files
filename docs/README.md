# XiaoNetwork Project Pterodactyl Files

### Internal Repository, Do Not Distribute, Violators Will Be Prosecuted

---

This is used to store some things related to the Pterodactyl panel.

- The `builder` directory contains tools related to image building. Among them, `general` is a general image, and `minecraft` is a Minecraft server image.
- The `template` directory contains backup configurations for the Pterodactyl panel, both in yml and json formats. Conversion between the two formats can be done using the `tool.py` located in this directory.

**Please note: Only json versions of the preset configuration files can be imported. Please do not import yml versions directly.**
