# XiaoNetwork Project Pterodactyl Files

### Internal Repository, Do Not Distribute, Violators Will Be Prosecuted

---

This repository is used to store things related to the Pterodactyl panel.

- The `builder` directory contains tools for image building. The `general` directory contains the general image, and the `minecraft` directory contains the Minecraft server image.
- The `template` directory contains backup configurations for the Pterodactyl panel, both in yml and json formats. Conversion between the two formats can be done using the `tool.py` located in this directory.

**Please note: Only json versions of the backup configurations can be imported. Please do not directly import yml versions.**
